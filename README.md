### swarm.py contains my implementation of swarm algorithm that accepts a function to approximate value for.
### This algorithm is then applied as an approximation function in ANFIS (Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), a tool for fuzzy logic operations.
### The presentation how it works is in Laboratorium 4.ipynb, where it is used to teach ANFIS multiplication table.
